**Updated:** 2026-09-27 (M45 merged)

## Where we are
A playable map game for 2–6 players (hotseat viewer vs AIs): two factions (**Jilliath**, **Ral-Vitahl**) with tier-1 melee/support/mage and Nexus mages to tier 3; bandit camps, dungeons with rewards, neutral cities; gold, mana and spells; nodes (gold, Blacksmith, mana, Cathedral); items on leaders; fog of war; retreat and a battle round limit; sound slots with placeholder SFX and music. The AI plays both the map (a list of planners in `world/ai.ts`) and battles, in a web worker.

Architecture: `design/architecture.md`; recipes and gotchas: `engineering.md`. `pnpm verify` before calling anything done. Sims: `pnpm sim:many --seeds 1-16 "p1,p2"` (smoke tests only until factions have their lines).

## Now
**M45 UI kit pilot** (merged into main): the city screen wears generated UI pieces (`assets/ui/`: carved frame, marble plaque, stone buttons, medallion tabs, a gargoyle over the rail), after the user's Disciples II reference. The rest of the UI is unchanged until the user has judged the pilot. Also: smooth WASD glide on the map. The user's read of the dressed map (foliage, lighting, low poly, props not sitting in the ground) is in `design/map-look.md`; the city view they mean is a painted town screen (`design/capitol-screen.md`).

## Next
1. Waiting on the user: `questions.md` (unit designs first: Jilliath's tier-2 support and mage, then Grove/Wastes tier 1, then tribes).
2. Claude's plan: things that don't need designs: the map's look (grass, terrain), AI scouting on big maps, research-tree connectors, tribes' foundation (a neutral faction type the bandits move into).
